**Decontaminating genomic data for accurate species delineation and hybrid detection in the *Lasius* ant genus**   


- Scripts used for the competitive mapping of Lasius RADseq reads to eliminate contamination can be found in `/1_competitive_mapping`  
  
- Scripts used to artificially "haploidize" the competitively mapped reads can be found in `/2_haploid_filtering`  
  
- Scripts used to filter competitively mapped reads based on allelic depth ratio can be found in `/3_ADR_filtering`  
  
- Treefile of the COI phylogeny for all successfully sequenced Lasius individuals can be found in `/4_COI_phylogeny`
